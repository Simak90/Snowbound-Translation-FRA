Note: This is an example weapon from the Constructor mod, hence the comments below.


- The ".construct" files are basically the bread and butter of this sdk resource/mod
- It aims to ease you of having manually to construct every teeny tiny object, it also tries to maintain the games
- integrity while adding your newly created objects.
- For example, if you construct a new "ClassModDefinition" it will automatically be appended to the
- "ClassModDefinitions" array in "ClassModBalanceDefinition".

- For this example lets create a custom gun.
- For a completely new gun we want to start with its "WeaponBalanceDefinition"
- The "#" in the ".construct" files is used to determine the class which our to be cloned object is an instance of.

#WeaponBalanceDefinition
- To construct a new object the syntax is as follows: <object_template> [new object Name] [new object Outer]
- For this "WeaponBalanceDefinition" we do not need a different Outer, but we want our own Name to easily tell our objects apart.

GD_Weap_Shotgun.A_Weapons_Legendary.SG_Bandit_5_SledgesShotgun SG_Bandit_5_Confetti
- The line above will now construct a "WeaponBalanceDefinition'GD_Weap_Shotgun.A_Weapons_Legendary.SG_Bandit_5_Confetti'"

- We also may want a new "WeaponPartDefinition" for our weapon, in most cases this will be a unique Barrel
#WeaponPartDefinition
GD_Weap_Shotgun.Barrel.SG_Barrel_Jakobs_Sledges SG_Barrel_Confetti
- Now we have successfully constructed the object "WeaponPartDefinition'GD_Weap_Shotgun.Barrel.SG_Barrel_Confetti'"

- Just for the sake of it, lets add also a new Material, so that we can later add our own custom skin to it:
GD_Weap_Shotgun.ManufacturerMaterials.Mat_Bandit_5_Legendary Mat_Bandit_5_Legendary_Confetti


- A unique weapon without a "FiringModeDefinition" is just boring, so lets just add one.
#FiringModeDefinition
GD_Weap_Shotgun.FiringModes.Bullet_Shotgun_Teeth Bullet_Shotgun_Confetti


- Our new Weapon also needs a Title (the object related to its name and redtext)
#WeaponNamePartDefinition
GD_Weap_Shotgun.Name.Title_Bandit.Title_Legendary_Shotgun Title_Legendary_Confetti

- Awesome, we now have constructed all the needed objects for our own custom weapon.
- Keep in mind, the new objects all used templates, this means it uses all the values from the object we used as a template.
- So the next thing we want to do is go in to BLCMM and "glue" our new objects together. (See "example1.blcm")

- You may have noticed, that we did not manually constructed the "WeaponPartListCollectionDefinition"
- That is because it will be automatically be constructed if you decide to construct a "WeaponBalanceDefinition"
- For our WeaponBalanceDefinition'GD_Weap_Shotgun.A_Weapons_Legendary.SG_Bandit_5_Confetti' will also
- "GD_Weap_Shotgun.A_Weapons_Legendary.SG_Bandit_5_Confetti:WeaponPartListCollectionDefinition_1000" constructed and assigned to it.
- So that you can easily add or change parts for your new guns.
