=========================

- Added 70+ new unique items.
	- No replacements!

	  that will explain its effects.

However, I encourage you to NOT use this spreadsheet! The challenges tab ingame has been replaced with the Codex. This will identify each dedicated drop source,
and show how many drops they have. This is the best way to find dedicated drops spoiler-free.
